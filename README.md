In this course you will cover HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework, which is the most widely used CSS framework today.<br><br>
I think the coolest part of this course is that after learning the fundamentals, you're actually going to take a field trip to one of the
local businesses in Baltimore, which doesn't have a good website, take down the requirements, and build a real website for that business from scratch.
